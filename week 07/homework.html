    <h1>Programming design Systems</h1>
    <p><b>Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions.</b></p>
    <p>While this explanation may seem somewhat abstract, I believe it's quite apt. Every user action is considered a "state," and transitions, loading, and animations are all part of the practical logic.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>History has shown us that systems can cure the fear of the blank canvas, and it is a powerful concept to encode these ideas into actual software.</b></p>
    <p>I understand the blank canvas as: a systematic design provides creators with a structure to follow—such as interface logic, information architecture, and interaction rules. And this is not merely a technical act, but a design that concretizes thought—code is the materialization of ideas.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>there is no reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product.</b></p>
    <p>Yes. I believe that as a designer, it's best to be present throughout every stage of product development to maximize the transmission of the work's inherent concept.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>Those celebrating computational design as a spectacle without identifying how projects are made or why they are successful.</b></p>
    <p>I deeply understand this. When I was learning coding online in China, many responses were merely demonstrations or general summaries, lacking the patience for in-depth discussion.</p>

    <h1>What Do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>

    <p><b>“We propose a change in the language used to talk about prototypes — to focus on what they prototype rather than on what they are made of.”</b></p>
    <p>This statement is insightful; it fundamentally transforms design thinking. Designers are no longer bound by the superficial aspects of tools or fidelity, but instead return to the "thinking function" of prototypes. It reminds us that prototypes are not results, but a form of inquiry—a way of thinking in uncertainty.</p>
    <br>


    <p><b>"A prototype is any representation of a design idea, regardless of medium."</b></p>
    <p>This statement broadens the definition of a prototype and challenges the traditional prejudice that "a prototype must be a digital or functional model." From storyboards to building blocks, from animations to the simulated interactive "Wizard of Oz," these can all become tools for design exploration. It makes "prototype" more of a way of thinking than a production standard.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b> "Prototypes themselves are not self-explanatory; it is the designer's responsibility to clarify what is and not be explored."</b></p>
    <p>Audiences often misunderstand the meaning of prototypes. Designers must not only "create prototypes," but also "explain prototypes"—explaining their assumptions, boundaries, and goals. This makes prototypes not merely experimental tools, but also part of the design narrative.</p>
