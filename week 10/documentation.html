    <p>I tried to replicate the progress I made in class based on the photos, but I found it completely incomprehensible; I was just piecing things together randomly. The code was also unfamiliar, and trying to piece it together following the video was equally unfamiliar, so I tried for a long time without any results.</p>

    <p> Next, I checked the teacher's replies on Slack and the introduction on Adafruit, and started working on the blinking light problem again.</p>

    <p> Then I tried adding a potentiometer, but the light didn't turn on and the code threw an error, so following the YouTube video wasn't entirely suitable for my board.</p>

      <p>Finally, I consulted chatgpt about the parts I didn't understand, and only after understanding the reason for each piece of code and the data location of the wiring ports was I able to complete it. The rotation angle is divided into 0-33 degrees, 33-66 degrees, and 66-99 degrees, and the light will flash at different frequencies (increasingly faster).</p>
