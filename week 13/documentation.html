    <p><b>Materials Preparation </b>
    <p>I plan to try the idea the teacher mentioned in class of using a box as a platform, with the sensor boxes placed on top. However, I realized that even the smallest box was not thin enough, so I stacked paper boxes, punched holes, and cut openings large enough for the USB to pass through.</p>

        <br><br>
    <p> Since it was my first attempt connecting external sensors, I was unsure about the wiring. As a result, my first attempt to connect a button (3.3 V → button → D13) failed.</p>

    <p> I initially thought I could use the code from class that connects four buttons directly, so the button was not recognized. After changing the code to test only one button, it worked. Later, I realized that the issue was the resistor was placed incorrectly.</p>

    <p><b>The effect of producing sound using a button has been restored </b>
    <p> Following the same process, I recreated what we learned in class by using buttons to trigger sounds. However, connecting the sensors to the ports through paper was very unstable and they easily came loose. Since I did not have a hot glue gun, I used double-sided tape on the back, which worked slightly better.</p>

    <p><b>Added potentiometer</b>
    <p> Testing in Arduino to see whether the values can be read correctly.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p><b>Added potentiometer in Processing</b>
    <p> I attempted to add a potentiometer along with visual feedback. The plan was to use the potentiometer to control the volume of a new audio track, which would loop continuously. While adjusting the volume, a rectangular volume bar on the screen would change accordingly. I followed a tutorial to add the potentiometer in Processing, but in the end, neither the audio volume nor the volume bar changed, even though the values were updating.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p><b>The volume did not change.</b>
    <p> Since the audio always played at a fixed volume as soon as the program started, I thought that setting the volume to 0 might make the changes more noticeable. I therefore remapped the 0–4095 sensor values to the volume range and added volume smoothing. However, after playback started, the sound became completely silent, and the potentiometer no longer had any effect.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p> When I reconnected the button to test everything together, I found that the button-triggered sounds were also no longer working. After reviewing the assignment, I realized that it only required four controllers rather than four different types of sensors, so I decided to switch back to using buttons. Because the paper-box wiring setup was still too unstable and the wires came loose easily, I eventually returned to using a breadboard.</p>

    <p><b>Sound generates blocks</b>
    <p> I created the DrumVisual class to represent each visual block that appears when a button is triggered. This class stores the block’s position, size, color, and whether it is still “alive,” and the constructor initializes these values when a new block is created. By doing this, I can easily generate, display, and remove multiple visual elements independently in response to sound events.</p>

    <p> By the same logic, I also created yellow, green, and blue blocks, and adjusted their size parameters to make the visuals more dynamic. I didn’t like the bordered effect, so I removed the outlines. In the end, it looked quite nice, even though I only used buttons as sensors.</p>
